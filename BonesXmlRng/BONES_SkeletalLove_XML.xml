<verse1>
    I was in the whip alone, on my mobile phone<lb n ="1"/>
    Tryna figure out the play while the night was young<lb n ="2"/>
    Reclinin' on butter pecan leather seats<lb n ="3"/>
    Same color as my drink, Buffalo Trace<lb n ="4"/>
    Got a message from my brother on call<lb n ="5"/>
    Told me, <quote>Slide, get high, figure out what the move is</quote><lb n ="6"/>
    Said, I'll be right there, my chain don't fight fair<lb n ="7"/>
    The diamonds always bitin', jewelry game is a nightmare<lb n ="8"/>
    Pulled up, hopped out, hit the button<lb n ="9"/>
    They buzzed me up, then I noticed somethin'<lb n ="10"/>
    The glim west building had a bloody red glow<lb n ="11"/>
    All I see is silhouettes movin' 'round in the window<lb n ="12"/>
    Suddenly my interest shifted<lb n ="13"/>
    All of a sudden, I'm dyin' to know the business<lb n ="14"/>
    Quickly hit a 180, took the stairs to the sidewalk<lb n ="15"/>
    Detective Bones, on the case like it was my job<lb n ="16"/>
    I knocked twice on the door and the music stopped<lb n ="17"/>
    The red lights turned off, maybe they thought it was cops<lb n ="18"/>
    The doorknob twist, to my surprise<lb n ="19"/>
    It was a female skeleton with gemstone eyes<lb n ="20"/>

    Excuse me ma'am, I don't mean to bother<lb n ="23"/>
    But somethin' magnetic brought me to your door<lb n ="24"/>
    And I know we haven't met before and that's facts<lb n ="25"/>
    But lookin' at you now, somehow, I feel we have<lb n ="26"/>
    She waved me in, led me into the living room<lb n ="27"/>
    Ironic 'cause she's dead and me, I gave up living too<lb n ="28"/>
    I sit down while she walks to the kitchen<lb n ="29"/>
    Brings back a cup of blood with no ice in it<lb n ="30"/>
    I know it's strange to say the least but I drink it<lb n ="31"/>
    I don't even hesitate, let alone start thinkin'<lb n ="32"/>
    Her eyes start blinkin' and her mouth open up<lb n ="33"/>
    She emits a beepin' sound, then I woke up<lb n ="34"/>
