<page pNum="222">Parade

Seven ladies
and seventeen gentlemen
at the Elks Club Lounge
planning planning a parade:
Grand Marshal in his white suit
will lead it.
Cadillacs with dignitaries
will precede it.
And behind will come
with band and drum
on foot...on foot...
on foot...

Motorcycle cops,
white,
will speed it
out of sight
if they can:
Solid black
can't be right.

Marching...marching...
marching...
noon till night...

I never knew
that many Negroes
were on earth,
did you?

I never knew!

PARADE!

Children's Rhymes

When I was a chile we used to play,
"One-two-buckle my shoe!"
and things like that. But now, Lord,
listen at them little varmints

By what sends
the white kids
I ain't sent:
I know I can't 
be President.

There is two thousand children
in this block, I do believe!

What don't bug
them white kids
sure bugs me:
We knows everybody
ain't free!

<page pNum="224">Some of these young ones is cert'ly bad-
One batted a hard ball right through my window 
and my gold fish et the glass

What's written down
for white folks 
aiun't for us a-tall:
"Liberty And Justice-
Huh-For All."

Oop-pop-a-da!
Skee! Daddle-de-do!
Be-bop!

Salt'Peanuts!

De-dop!

Sister

That little Negro's married and got a kid.
Why does he keep on foolin' around Marie?
Marie's my sister-not married to me-
But why does he keep on foolin' around Marie
Why don't she get a boy-friend
I can understand-some decent man?

Did it ever occur to you, son,
the reason Marie runs around with trash
is she wants some cash?

Don't decent folks have dough?

<page pNum="225">Unfortunatey usually no!

Well, anyway, it don't have to be a married man/

Did it ever occur to you, boy,
that a women does the best she can?

Comment on Stoop
So does a man.

Preference

I likes a woman
six or eight and ten years older'n myself.
I don't fool with these young girls.
Young gir'll say,
Daddy, I want so-and-so.
I needs this, that, and the other.
But an old woman'll say,
Honey, what does YOU need?
I just drawed my money tonight
and it's all your'n.
That's why I likes a older woman
who can appreciate me:
When she conversations you
it ain't forever, Gimme!
